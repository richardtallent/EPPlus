# EPPlus

** EPPlus has moved from LGPL to another license, and is hosted at https://github.com/EPPlusSoftware/EPPlus.**

** This is a fork of the last LGPL version, which I'm maintaining only for fixing bugs for my own use. **

I will accept PRs that are easy to review and limited in scope, and that are also intended for bug fixes rather than new features.

I won't be trying to maintain backward compatibility with the code style or functionality of EPPlus.

I'll come up with a new name when I have a chance so there's no potential for confusion.
